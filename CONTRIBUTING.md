## Bug reports

A bug is a *demonstrable problem* that is caused by the code in the repository.
Good bug reports are extremely helpful - thank you!

A good bug report shouldn't leave others needing to chase you up for more
information. Please try to be as detailed as possible in your report. What is
your environment? What steps will reproduce the issue? What would you expect to
be the outcome? All these details will help people to fix any potential bugs.

## Pull requests

Good pull requests - patches, improvements, new features - are a fantastic
help. Thanks for taking the time to contribute.

**Please ask first** before embarking on any significant pull request,
otherwise you risk spending a lot of time working on something that the
project's developer might not want to merge into the project.
